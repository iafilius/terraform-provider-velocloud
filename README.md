# terraform-provider-velocloud
working on a velocloud provider for terraform, and looking for contacts also bound to velocloud NDA

As the REST api (documentation) is only available under NDA currently, developping a terraform provider for velocloud can't be public.
But seeking contact and cooperating with other velocloud enthousiasts, which are about to develop own Velocloud as Code tooling.


Status update
Implemented first versions of:
 - Edge deployment
 - Enterprise Profiles
