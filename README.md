# terraform-provider-velocloud
working on a velocloud provider for terraform, and looking for contacts also bound to velocloud NDA

As the REST api (documentation) is only available under NDA currently, developping a terraform provider for velocloud can't be public.
But seeking contact and cooperating with other velocloud enthousiasts, which are about to develop own Velocloud as Code tooling.
